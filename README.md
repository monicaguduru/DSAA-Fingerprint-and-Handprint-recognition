"# DSAA-Fingerprint-and-Handprint-recognition" 
I have made a matlab application which takes fingerprint images as inputs converts to gray scale image and matches them by checking the direction of the grooves and ridges of our hand. I already stored few fingerprints in my database with which I would match. I also displayed the match percentage using GUI in matlab.
